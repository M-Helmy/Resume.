## Clearing the Cache Without Drupal 8 GUI <br/>

Using the rebuild script
Open settings.php (/sites/default/settings.php) in any text editor. Add this line to the end of the file and save it:

{: .box-note}
$settings['rebuild_access'] = TRUE;<br/>

Visit http://www.YourDomainName.com/core/rebuild.php in your browser (where www.YourDomainName.com is your siteâ€™s URL). After a short pause, you should be redirected to the home page of your site, and the cache should be rebuilt.
Open settings.php (/sites/default/settings.php) in a text editor. Find the line you added with (( $settings[rebuild_access] )) remove this line, and save the file.<br/>
